TouTiao Recruit:
hardness of each three questions should meet the listed requirements:
a <=b <= c
b - a <= 10
c - b <= 10

in total n open topics were drawn. 
now we want these n problems can be distributed 
to several test rounds(1 round or more rounds, 
each question must be use and can only be used once), 
each test round includes three problems.
however, due to the limitation of the above conditions, 
there will be some tests which have not enough 3 problem, 
so staff in TouTiao will need to draw some more questions 
in appropriate difficulty to meet the requirements
you should calculate the minimum we need to out a few problem
